--4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

		WITH position_grouping AS	
				(SELECT yearid, PO,
					CASE WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'
						WHEN pos = 'P' OR pos = 'C' THEN 'Battery'
						ELSE 'Infield' END AS player_position
			FROM fielding
			WHERE yearid = '2016') 
SELECT player_position, SUM(PO) AS total_putouts
FROM position_grouping
GROUP BY player_position
